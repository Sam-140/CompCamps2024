                Hi! I am Samuel, and I am a student at regina computer camp. At my time here I've been able to develope a
                game, thanks to the mentors I can show all of you the game I like to share with you all
            </p>
            <p>
                The game I made is a remaster of the old Atari game "Asteroids 1979"
            </p>

            <p>
                To start off we learned about the basics, later on in full tutorial style we got our games working... eventually, some of us got behind, our codes crumbled. but thanks to the mentors the game you can play is in the fullest amount of time and patience yu can get.
