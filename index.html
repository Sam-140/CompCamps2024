            <p>
                Hi! I am Samuel, and I am a student at regina computer camp. At my time here I've been able to develop a
                game, thanks to the mentors I can show all of you the game I like to share with you all
            </p>
            <p> I signed up for Comp Camp to learn about coding, I am familiar with lua coding on Roblox.
                I've created a game called "Ultimate Obby", don't try searching it up you probably won't find it, how the Roblox algorithim works is weird (to me) </p>

        <h3>Asteroids:
            A bit about Asteroids
        </h3>
        <p>
            The game I made is a remaster of the old Atari game "Asteroids 1979"
        <p>
        <p>
            Asteroids is a space themed game released onto the Atari on Novemeber 1979, It was designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg. </p>

            </h3>         
             <p>
                To start off we learned about the basics, later on in full tutorial style we got our games working
                The game I remastered is filled with new sprites and animations.
            </p>
             <p>
                Later on created my unique sprites to add my own twist to my game,
                starting off with "Press start" Loading screen with a nice and simplistic animation.
             </p>

                This picture is where all the action happens when you start the game,
                 which i think is very cool!
