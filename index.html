                Hi! I am Samuel, and I am a student at regina computer camp. At my time here I've been able to develope a
                game, thanks to the mentors I can show all of you the game I like to share with you all
            </p>
            <p>
                The game I made is a remaster of the old Atari game "Asteroids 1979"
            </p>
        </section>
        <h3>Asteroids</h3>
        <h4>A bit about Asteroids (1979)</h4>
        <p>
            Asteroids is a space themed game released onto the Atari on Novemeber 1979, It was designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg.

            </h3>
            <p>
                To start off we learned about the basics, later on in full tutorial style we got our games working
                The game I remastered is filled with new sprites and animations

                This picture is where all the action happens when you start the game,
                 which i think is very cool!
